# Priority

With this feature you have the ability to define the processing priority of your POST request to /v3/media

Media can be submitted with different priority depending on the urgency of the request. This is helpful to obtain better pricing on archive processing, or to increase the speed with which transcripts are returned for time-sensitive items like voicemail.

VoiceBase offers low, normal, and high priority processing. Normal priority is the default. If your use case requires low or high priority processing, please contact 
[Voicebase Sales](http://info.voicebase.com/contact-sales) to learn more about pricing.
