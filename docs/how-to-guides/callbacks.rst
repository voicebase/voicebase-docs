Callbacks
=========

VoiceBase can optionally make a callback request to a specific url when
media upload processing is complete.

Uploading Media with Callbacks Enabled
--------------------------------------

To request a processing-completed callback from VoiceBase, include a
JSON configuration attachment with your media POST. The configuration
attachment should contain the publish key, for example as below:

  *Notes:*

  - Each callback in the set below will result in a unique call to the specified server upon media completion.
  - If "type" is not specified: "analytics" is assumed and all sections will be included (transcript, knowledge, metadata, prediction, streams, spotting)

.. code:: json


    {
      "publish": {
        "callbacks": [
          {
            "url" : "https://example.org/callback"
          },
          {
            "url" : "https://example.org/callback",
            "method" : "POST",
            "include" : [ "transcript", "knowledge", "metadata", "prediction", "streams", "spotting" ]
          },
          {
            "url" : "https://example.org/callback/vtt",
            "method" : "PUT",
            "type" : "transcript",
            "format" : "vtt"
          },
          {
            "url" : "https://example.org/callback/srt",
            "method" : "PUT",
            "type" : "transcript",
            "format" : "srt"
          },
          {
            "url" : "https://example.org/callback/media",
            "method" : "PUT",
            "type" : "media",
            "stream": "original"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

Configuration Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``publish`` : object for publish-specific configuration

   -  ``callbacks`` : array of callbacks, with one object per callback
      desired

      -  ``[n]`` : callback array element

         -  ``url`` : the https url for delivering a callback
            notification
         -  ``method`` : the HTTPS method for callback delivery, with
            the following supported values:

            -  ``POST``: deliver callbacks as an HTTP POST (default)
            -  ``PUT``: deliver callbacks as an HTTP PUT

         -  ``type`` : Type of results to callback

            -  ``analytics``: the result analytics in json format
               (default)
            -  ``transcript``: the transcript in specific format, see
               ``format`` attribute
            -  ``media``: the media, see ``stream`` attribute

         -  ``format`` : the format of the callback of type 'transcript'

            -  ``json``: transcript in json format (application/json)
            -  ``text``: transcript in text format (text/plain)
            -  ``webvtt``: transcript in webvvt format (text/vtt)
            -  ``srt``: transcript in srt format (text/srt)
            -  ``dfxp``: transcript in dfxp format
               (application/ttaf+xml)

         -  ``include`` : array of data to include with the callback of
            type 'analytics', with the following supported values. If
            "include" is omitted the callback will return all sections:

            -  ``metadata`` : include supplied metadata, often useful
               for correlated to records in a different system
            -  ``transcript``: include transcripts for the media on all
               formats.
            -  ``knowledge`` : include topics and keywords for the media
            -  ``prediction`` : include prediction information for the
               media based on supplied predictors
            -  ``spotting`` : include spotted groups information for the
               media based on supplied keyword groups
            -  ``streams`` : include links for the media

         -  ``stream`` : the media stream of type 'media'

            -  ``original``: the original media
            -  ``redacted-audio``: the redacted media

The following table shows the Content-Type of the requests when we call
you back with the results. This header is important if you are providing
pre-signed URLs generated for a service like Amazon AWS S3

============= ======== ====================
Type          Format   Content-Type header
============= ======== ====================
analytics        -     application/json
transcript      text   text/plain
transcript      json   application/json
transcript      srt    text/srt
transcript      dfxp   application/ttaf+xml
transcript     webvtt  text/vtt
media            -     application/octet-stream
============= ======== ====================

If the media fails to be processed, you will only receive the callbacks of type "analytics" describing the error that prevented the media from being processed.
Callbacks of type "transcript" and "media" will be ignored.

Example cURL Request with Callback
----------------------------------

For example, to upload media from a local file called recording.mp3 and
receive a callback at https://example.org/callback, make the following
POST request using curl, or an equivalent request using a tool of your
choice:

.. code:: bash


    curl https://apis.voicebase.com/v3/media \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
        --form media=@recording.mp3 \
        --form configuration='{
              "publish": {
                "callbacks": [
                  {
                    "url" : "https://example.org/callback",
                    "method" : "POST",
                    "include" : [ "transcript", "knowledge", "metadata", "prediction", "streams" ]
                  }
                ]
              }
          }'

When using callbacks, you can still query the status of the media
processing using a GET request to /v3/media/{mediaId}.

Callback Retry Logic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a success response is not achieved on the first attempt, VoiceBase
will do the following:

1) Retry immediately up to two times.
2) Put the callback delivery on schedule to re-attempt in 15 minutes,
   and the time doubled until it hits 16 hours between reattempts (in
   total, VoiceBase will stop after 36 hours).

If the file has not been accepted after step b) the status of the media
file will change to 'finished' and VoiceBase will stop attempting.

IP Whitelist
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All egress traffic flows from our servers out through one of these three
(currently) NAT gateways. The IPs are, 52.6.224.43 52.6.208.178
52.2.171.140

Callback Data
-------------

When media processing is complete, VoiceBase will call back your
specified endpoint by making an HTTPS POST request. The body is a JSON
object with the following data:

.. code:: json

      "mediaId": "710a4041-b78a-46ae-b626-773b90316c3b",
